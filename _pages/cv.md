Other interests
===============

I have participated to two estival editions of the [Spacebus](https://www.spacebusfrance.fr/) tour (2023 and 2024).
This is a unique (and fun) opportunity to do scientific mediation around astronomy and astrophysics topics to a very large public.

Due to the urgency of the global situation, I am also trying to do what I can in terms of climate activism, both in my professional and personal lives.
